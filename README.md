# Falcon's Nest Content Management System
## Brief Overview
The main purpose of this content management system is to create Posts for the Falcon Nest Blog. This blog is successfully being hosted, however, the management system can be run locally to save costs. The api calls will still require user authentication and a JSON WebToken in order to access the API routes. Rich Text editor has been implemented for anyone who is seeking a more robust article style. However, as a student, I would prefer a more simple route only for this instance.
